1. Docker Containers

   - A portable computing environment
   - It contains everything needed to run a workflow or application, including dependencies, code, and configuration.
   - Container (Image) : like a new computer which we need to copy our code/workflow and install all needed dependencies to it
   - Once everything is installed and configured, we can make backups (Container) of that computer
   - We can then make this backup on another computer.
   - This backup - packaging of code together with its dependencies (including the operating system) and configuration

2. Benefits of Container

   - Reproducibility : same input same output everything
   - Portability: run the same on whichever device, norisk of removed dependencies, lost configuration files or other changes that break our application
   - Isolation between container and and rest of environment
     - Running a container will have no impact outside of the container.
     - Containers are isolated from each other. NO INTERACTION WITH OTHER CONTAINERS.
     - Anything happening outside the container will not affect the result of a container
     - If the security of one container is compromised, other containers and host iteslf remain secure since no communication between containers
   - Limited resources access to host device operating system
   - Lightweight
     - In comparison to running application outside of a container, uses less resources
     - In comparison to virtual machine, which also provide isolation, lesser overhead

3. Benefits of containers make them relevant for data science

   - Make any task or workflow automatically repoducible everywhere
   - Avoid issues when sharing works
   - Automatically include dependencies, including dataset
   - Reusable across devices.
   - Sharable
