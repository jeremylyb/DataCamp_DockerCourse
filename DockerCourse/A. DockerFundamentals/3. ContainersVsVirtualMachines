1. Difference between Containers Vs Virtual Machines

   - Virtual machines virtualize entire machine down to the hardware, only hardware is shared
   - Containers virtualize the Host operating system and hardware, Host OS and hardware are shared

2. Issues with Containers

   - Since containers share Host Operating system : means attackers attacking a single container can break out the container and access the host OS and in turn access all containers running in the same machine.
   - This can compromise all other containers as well

3. Advantage of Container

   - Size and memory on disk compared to VMs - Lightweight
     - Containers require less RAM and less disk space
     - Containers are significantly smaller because they only need to include a small part of a full OS, sharing the rest of OS with the Host OS and other containers
