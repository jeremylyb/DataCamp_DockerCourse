- View list of images in our local machine
  docker images

- Remove Image
  docker image rm <image-name>

  - A container is a running image
  - Hence, we can only delete an image if there are no more container
  - If we attempt to delete an image with a container running, there will be a warning message
    indicating the container id still running

- Remove all running containers in an Image
  docker container prune

- Remove all unused container in image, not only dangling image
  docker image prune -a

  - dangling images are images without a name
