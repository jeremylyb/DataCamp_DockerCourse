- Different Docker container with different purposes may have different start commands
- For example, a Hello World container has a write string start command
- For a python script, it makes more sense for image to start a python session for user automatically and exist the session once that python session is stopped

1. Using CMD instruction

   CMD <shell-command>

   - Single parameter: shell command

- Runs when the image is started NOT executed when using docker build
- Adding CMD instruction does not increase image size and lead time to build
- If multiple CMD instruction exist, only last one will have any effect
- The more general the use case of the image, the more flexible the start command should be.
  - For example, if we make a general usage Ubuntu image, simply opening a shell would make sense as a start command. The image will then exit when the user exits the shell.

- There is a default start command for image but this can be overriden
- To override, just include the additional shell command when starting the imamge

  - Start an image
    docker run <image>

  - Include shell command. This will override the default CMD command
    docker run <image> <shell-command>

  - Start image interactively with a custom start command
    docker run -it <image> <shell-command>
    docker run -it ubuntu bash
    - using a shell as a new start command, for example, bash, allow us to look around the image, discover files and see what is installed
