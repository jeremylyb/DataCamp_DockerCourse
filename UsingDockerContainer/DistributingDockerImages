- Official docker registry and how to pull images
- Now we share images with selected people - through send files or through docker registry server

Private Docker Registries servers

- The Docker organization maintains the official Docker images registry.
- Other Docker registries work same way BUT are under the control of another person or group
- Hence, no guarantees that the images will work or are safe to use.
- Non official Docker organization jave URL of the private Docker registry they came from
  eg: dockerhub.myprivateregistry.com/classify_spam

- Use docker pull to pull from private registry as well

        docker pull <private-registry-url>/<image-name>
        docker pull dockerhub.myprivateregistry.com/classify_spam:v1

- Push image to a registry

        docker image push <image-name>

- Push to specific registry. In order to do so, we need to have the image start with the registry url. Hence we need to
  rename the image:

        docker tag <old-name><new-name>
        docker tag classify_spam:v1 dockerhub.myprivateregistry.com/classify_spam:v1

  docker tag to rename.
  After renaming, then we push it to private registry

        docker image push dockerhub.myprivateregistry.com/classify_spam:v1

- Docker official images no need authentication. But private Docker Repository, owner can configure
- The standard way to secure private Docker registries requires users to log in
- Login command:

        docker login dockerhub.myprivateregistry.com

- Sending Docker images as files

        docker save -o <file-name> <image-name>
        docker save -o image.tar classify_spam:v1

- Load an image from file

        docker load -i <file-name>
