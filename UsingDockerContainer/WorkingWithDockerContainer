- Listing containers commands
  docker ps

- Name a specific container with name flag
  docker run --name <container-name> <image-name>

        docker run --name db_pipeline_v1 postgress

  - Created a container from postgres image and called it db_pipeline_v1
  - With the named container, we can use any command with it

    docker stop <container-name>

- Filtering running containers

        docker ps -f "name=<container-name>"

- Look at output logs of containers generated to debug any issues. Can use container name or id

        docker logs <container-id>
        docker logs <container-name>

- f flag (follow flag) allow us to see the logs generated by container LIVE

        docker logs -f <container-id>

  - docker ps also have a f flag. It allow us to filter
  - ctrl + c to exit the live logs

- Stop container does not fully remove from harddrive and still occupying space.
  To fully remove:
  docker container rm <container-id>
